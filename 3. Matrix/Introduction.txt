In Python, you can represent matrices using nested lists or using specialized libraries like NumPy.
Using Nested Lists:
# Example of a 2x3 matrix using nested lists
matrix = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6]
]

# Accessing elements
print(matrix[0][1])  # Outputs 2

# Iterating through elements
for row in matrix:
    for element in row:
        print(element, end=' ')
    print()

Using NumPy:
NumPy is a powerful library for numerical operations in Python. It provides a numpy.array class that you can use for matrices.
import numpy as np

# Creating a NumPy array (matrix)
matrix = np.array([
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6]
])

# Accessing elements
print(matrix[0, 1])  # Outputs 2

# Iterating through elements
for row in matrix:
    for element in row:
        print(element, end=' ')
    print()
